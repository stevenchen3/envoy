1.15.0 (Pending)
================

Changes
-------

* access loggers: added GRPC_STATUS operator on logging format.
* access loggers: extened specifier for FilterStateFormatter to output :ref:`unstructured log string <config_access_log_format_filter_state>`.
* dynamic forward proxy: added :ref:`SNI based dynamic forward proxy <config_network_filters_sni_dynamic_forward_proxy>` support.
* fault: added support for controlling the percentage of requests that abort, delay and response rate limits faults 
  are applied to using :ref:`HTTP headers <config_http_filters_fault_injection_http_header>` to the HTTP fault filter.
* filter: add `upstram_rq_time` stats to the GPRC stats filter.
  Disabled by default and can be enabled via :ref:`enable_upstream_stats <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.grpc_stats.v3.FilterConfig.enable_upstream_stats>`.
* grpc-json: added support for streaming response using
  `google.api.HttpBody <https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto>`_.
* http: fixed a bug where the upgrade header was not cleared on responses to non-upgrade requests.
  Can be reverted temporarily by setting runtime feature `envoy.reloadable_features.fix_upgrade_response` to false.
* http: remove legacy connection pool code and their runtime features: `envoy.reloadable_features.new_http1_connection_pool_behavior` and
  `envoy.reloadable_features.new_http2_connection_pool_behavior`.
* logger: added :ref:`--log-format-prefix-with-location <operations_cli>` command line option to prefix '%v' with file path and line number.
* network filters: added a :ref:`postgres proxy filter <config_network_filters_postgres_proxy>`.
* network filters: added a :ref:`rocketmq proxy filter <config_network_filters_rocketmq_proxy>`.
* request_id: added to :ref:`always_set_request_id_in_response setting <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.always_set_request_id_in_response>`
  to set :ref:`x-request-id <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` header in response even if
  tracing is not forced.
* router: allow retries of streaming or incomplete requests. This removes stat `rq_retry_skipped_request_not_complete`.
* router: allow retries by default when upstream responds with :ref:`x-envoy-overloaded <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-overloaded_set>`.
* tracing: tracing configuration has been made fully dynamic and every HTTP connection manager
  can now have a separate :ref:`tracing provider <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.provider>`.
* upstream: fixed a bug where Envoy would panic when receiving a GRPC SERVICE_UNKNOWN status on the health check.

Deprecated
----------

* Tracing provider configuration as part of :ref:`bootstrap config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.tracing>`
  has been deprecated in favor of configuration as part of :ref:`HTTP connection manager
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.provider>`.
